# Livewire Markets Interview Preparation

## Interview Focus Areas
Based on the provided guidelines, this interview preparation covers:

1. **Big-O Notation** - Understanding time and space complexity
2. **Basic Data Structures** - Arrays, linked lists, hash maps, stacks, queues, heaps
3. **Practical Understanding** - Real-world applications, not tricky algorithms
4. **Clear Communication** - Explaining thought process and trade-offs

## How to Use This Preparation

1. **Start with Big-O Examples** - Understand how to analyze complexity
2. **Practice Data Structures** - Implement and explain each structure
3. **Review Practical Examples** - Connect theory to real-world usage
4. **Practice Communication** - Use templates to explain your thinking

## Key Interview Tips

- **Think Out Loud** - Explain your reasoning as you code
- **Discuss Trade-offs** - When would you use each data structure?
- **Consider Edge Cases** - What could go wrong?
- **Optimize Iteratively** - Start with working solution, then improve
